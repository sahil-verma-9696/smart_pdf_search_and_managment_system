# Theme
**Smart PDF Search and Management System**   
* Organizations often struggle to manage and search across large collections of PDF documents with varied lengths and diverse content.  
* These documents are typically spread across multiple storage solutions,  
* creating inefficiencies and hindering accessibility.  
* Users need a centralized platform to store, search, and query data across all documents,  
* with the ability to upload new files and have them indexed and searchable. 

**Challenge Goal:**  
* Build an AI-powered solution that centralizes document storage,  
* provides robust search capabilities,  
* and leverages AI to answer questions based on document content.  
* The system should ensure scalability, usability, and timely indexing of new uploads for seamless data management.
